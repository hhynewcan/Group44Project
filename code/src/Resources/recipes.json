Fill with enough cold water to cover the beef. Bring to a boil over high heat, lower the flame, cover and simmer for 2 hours or until the beef is tender.\nUse a slotted spoon to remove and discard the onions and garlic (they've done their job and have given all their flavor already).\nPeel the potatoes, I use red potatoes and peel only the center because I like the look of it, but feel free to peel all of it or don't peel at all. Cut the carrots into large chunks. Place the potatoes and carrots into the pot with the brisket. Return to a boil over high heat and then reduce heat and simmer until fork tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. It depends on how big your potatoes are.\nTransfer the potatoes and carrots to a platter and keep warm. Add in the sliced cabbage, I like to keep the core in the cabbage so that the sliced wedges stay in tact, making it easier to move later. Bring back up to a boil over high heat. Lower the flame and simmer for 15 minutes until the cabbage is tender as well.\nTransfer the cabbage to the platter along with the potatoes and carrots and move the brisket to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain. Arrange the sliced beef along with the vegetables on the platter. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with grainy mustard and horseradish sauce (recipe follows).\nTo make the sauce, set a medium saucepan over moderate heat with the butter. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 30 seconds or so. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of the liquid that the beef cooked inches Cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the sugar, vinegar, horseradish, salt and pepper.",

		"instructions": "Slice one onion and place in crock pot.\nPut in the roast and cover with the other onion, sliced. Pour over the ginger ale. Cover and cook on LOW for about 12 hours. See Note2 below regarding amount of time needed!\nRemove the meat, strain and save the onions, discard all liquid. With two forks, shred the meat, discarding any remaining fat, bones or skin. Most of the fat will have melted away.\nReturn the shredded meat and the onions to the crock pot, stir in the barbecue sauce. Continue to cook for another 4 to 6 hours on LOW.\nServe with hamburger buns or rolls and additional barbecue sauce. Any leftovers freeze very well.\nTIP: freeze ready-made sandwiches - a scoop of meat on a bun, well-wrapped. These make a great quick meal or snack. To reheat, remove wrapping, wrap in a paper towel, and zap 1-2 minute in the microwave.\nNote: Shoulder or butt are recommended because the meat shreds very well. Other cuts do not shred as readily. It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid.\nNote 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!\nNote3: You might want to turn your roast over after it's cooked a while, to ensure more even cooking. I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker. Remember that each time you remove the lid you lose heat and be careful, as turning a large piece of meat is awkward.\nNote4: my sister says this takes 2 hours in the Instapot. I don't have one, up to you to figure out the steps",
